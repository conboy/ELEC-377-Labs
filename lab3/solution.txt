the skipChar() function takes in a pointer to the first character in the 
commandBuffer array and gets rid of the leading spaces.

the splitCommandLine() function parses the arguments from the commandBuffer
with the help of the skipChar() function.

Once the desired command and arguments are parsed, the function 
doInternalCommand() is run which takes the args and finds the 
right function to run from the commands struct and runs it.

doInternalCommand() can call:
exitFunc which exits the program
pwdFunc which prints the current working directory
