logsplit is a bash script that sorts the logs given in the argument into seperate files and
appends the time span of the printer and reader threads into their respective files.

First, the script checks if one argument is passed through the script if it is not one, the 
script exits with exit code 1. The script also checks if the file exists and is readable
using the test -r command if it gives exit code 1 then the script exits with code 1.

Then the script extracts only the reader messages using grep by searching for lines that
begin with "\[[0-9];[0-9][0-9]mR" and ouputs the reader messages to a new file called
"f.Reader" where f is the name of the file passed through the script. The script then looks
through the f.Reader file to look for the start time by using head to get the first line in 
the reader file and extracts the unix time without the decimal using cut and sed. It also
gets the end time by using tail to get the last line of the reader and cut and sed in the
same manner. Finally, it appends the time span to the reader file after doing arithmetic
using printf to format it.

The script does the same thing it did with the reader messages but to the printer messages
this time sending all of the output to the "f.Printer" file where f is the name of the file
passed through the script.

The script finds the number of machines by using grep in the same way it did in the printer
and reader steps except it uses [0-5] instead of P or R to take only the lines that have a
number from 0 to 5 as the program only supports up to 6 machines. The script extracts the 
machine number in the line using the cut command and gets rid of uniques and sorts the machines
using sort -u.

Finally, the script extracts each machines messages and outputs them to their respective
file with the convention "f.Machine#" where f is the filename passed through the script
and # is the machine number.
