To test, we looked at the output log uptimes versus the delay in the machine text files. On the first line in the machine txt files,
there is a delay of 900, 1020, 1240. Looking at the uptimes in the output logs for each machine, they do not go over 
their delay time specified in the machine txt file, which is good. Below is the last uptime they have before resetting
to back to zero.

MACHINE | UP | UPTIME | LAST UPDATE  
-----------------------------------------------------
0       | 1  | 9      | 1665991381
1       | 1  | 8      | 1665991382
2       | 1  | 8      | 1665991382

// BELOW IS OUTPUT AFTER THE ABOVE ONE

MACHINE | UP | UPTIME | LAST UPDATE  
-----------------------------------------------------
0       | 0  | 0      | 1665991389
1       | 0  | 0      | 1665991390
2       | 0  | 0      | 1665991390

Looking at the second line in the machine txt file, the delay for all the machines is 8000. In the output logs it can 
be observed that the machines do not go over the specified delay which means it works properly. Machine 1 is showing
an uptime of zero because it is down, eventually it will reach it's specified delay and reset to 0.
